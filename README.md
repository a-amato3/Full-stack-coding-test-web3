## Instructions

Please make sure you have Node js installed first and then install NestJS on your machine to run this project. To connect the smart contract to a network, you will need to have Ganachhe (download at: https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/).
Please complete the setup of the software to have a node setup on your local instance which the NestJS backend can connect to.

Go to the App Service file in the prject and add your environment variables as instructed via the comments (Ganache is setup on http://localhost:7545 as default.)
You will need to retrieve your address from the Transactions tab to use where the comment asks for Token address to be pasted

## Problems and solutionn

- The Learnng curve was the first major issue, because although I've interacted with Web3 in different projects. I have not done a full stack app as comprehensive as this one so it was necessary to spend some time learning and gathering information for wider context before starting and carrying out the test

- Networks were an issue at the begeinning, so i deicded to stick with localhost. In the future I would have a custom URL which would allow Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon and Arbitrum as options.

- To overcome issues and difficulty, i browsed the varying documentation on the web for Web3 technologies. I decided to go with Web3.JS as my main library because the other ones out there (Ethers.js) was not as comprehensive.

## Reasoning behind your technical choices, including trade-offs you might have made

- I used NestJS because I am familar with the architecture of the framework from using the Angular framework.

- To complete the task I would have retrieved the metadata from the token (Symbol, Name, Decimal) in the getTokenInfo method
- Would use perhaps a differnt 3rd party lib such as Moralis to get the metadata of token in an easier way.

- I would have completed the test further by allowing more time to read through documentation and decide on the best 3rd party lib to go with

- The use of a FE in React to display the json object in a well designed list would also make the app more complete.
